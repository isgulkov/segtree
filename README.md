### `segtree` â€” the segment tree and friends 

Here I'm trying to implement [segment trees](https://e-maxx.ru/algo/segment_tree) and some related data structures as a proper, usable C++ template library, just for the fun of it.

Don't have the time for it now that I have a job, but I'm determined to finish this at some point.
